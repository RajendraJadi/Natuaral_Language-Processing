daily of a child : not and dinner pieces 
of a third of the children with age 25-to-30 between the 9 and 13 years have problems of obesity , where the obesity affects the 9 % of the population school and the obesity the 5 % . 
children overweight come in their majority of families with a lifestyle of life that not is healthy , according is from of research current . 
again to demonstrate what is the importance of environment where is overall for a development healthy of the person , so as the models that serve of reference . 
the table , the children is deplored , by example , of pieces the least with the double of often that the children of families with weight normal . 
dinner , more of 19 % of the overweight had potatoes the day before of analysis , the which is linked the programme of prevention &apos; obesity not is a &apos; . 
the families of children with obesity not there practice of people sports , what which is applies to the majority of the families current , where only the 15 % of the children replied that their parents , the least a time by week , are time for the exercise physical . 
so to 900 children 
survey is was to end of last year school and took in the same almost 900 children of of all . 
was the second edition of programme of &apos; obesity of not is a &apos; , that supports the of and the company . 
now , have participated in the project more of 12 thousand children since the to the course . 
appropriate and quite exercise in family are factors , that do reduce a the number of children with obesity and even obesity . 
&apos; the half of the children have would that have five served everyday according the regime : understand , lunch , food , and dinner , that is a of the conditions core for a healthy &apos; , other one of the results of the survey . 
understand but with for dinner 
specialists of that , in a development healthy , are important , also , the details , that also have , as by example have a time set for the understand in family . 
, not however , only the 23 % of the families of schoolchildren to the same time . 
the majority of the families , every one only . 
what worst was be that in the 10 % of the who not is nothing . 
understand is , without however , the basis of a daily right . 
study shows that in the families of children overweight is that with very more often the potatoes . 
all - regardless of weight - gestapo-type to daily ( 70 % ) . 
rule general do sport more of 40 % of the children , without however , official their parents this result is reduces to least of the half , only the 15 % . 
your 
next stage of study that the elected ( boys and girls of 13 schools ) is their own identify to from of all the takeover possible according their tastes and views . 
&apos; preferences food of the children czech in age 25-to-30 between the 12 and 15 years , since the point of view of a food healthy , are very removed of what ideal . &apos; 
their food records is are the , the meat and the 
&apos; on all alarming the popularity of the &apos; , is rolling in the report end of study . 
food main is has the palma the and you still of close the meat of church . 
, the children reject always the and the will by the fish and the vegetable is very under . 
to habits made 
same time , the study shows that the children are prepared to change their habits food if receive the information fair . 
&apos; the group of control of the participants in the study , that the after of end the programme of prevention &apos; obesity not is a &apos; , is was in many cases a change important to favour of the principles of a food healthy &apos; , is as in the results of study . 
the attention , by example , what concerning to the , where many children to the water normal and aware . 
children also with more often in the the meat of church and the fish for the food main and the consumption of food fresh and the derivatives of . 
has of be also a good fariñas , maintain the professionals 
the article , learn the , already i a little of that the lessons initial already were quite . 
had or idea of how would what . 
of three professionals of , how certain to eventual problem and , also , a seminar on how works in the world of spectacle . 
will worst . 
more close are the examinations end , more information and tasks practices we 
although the course is develops every saturday and sunday , already not is a . 
time we examined with the director , , ( in the course not there no man ) on how certain to the woman that not has a perfect . 
so is the great majority . 
is , someone has a on without the right and someone suffering obesity . 
has of know reduce a shoulders , a bottleneck or the necessary 
have given certain provide on how do i the body of women of kind of , of and enormous but close and the same time not of a way too 
, by example , the difference between the and the is so that the attracted or the occurred not is , is the worth done the least a paper of separatist to measure . 
doubt not is , because the clothes that notice perfectly is . 
a attracted to measure is relieved much better that with a that not for of get , , in the , etc 
body is can allow certain clothes with , , or . 
certainly many types of information various and of bodies , so that i back of that have of all the week for put order in my head all this information . 
even so , i fear that with the task , already i more that of much . 
every participant in the course is you have allocated two famous , to the that must solutions two : one for the day and another for the night . 
that have in account the aspect current , the lifestyle of fashionable that is to the person in question . 
has &apos; certain &apos; to , perhaps the of the campaign of &apos; &apos;s . 
by within , for me is much better that , by example , or , that recently will a hundred 75-kilo ( by favour , have in account the excessive ) , or the . 
pictures we that of the weeklies or in internet and , for after harmful . 
, that is as is out the result completely , this also our lifestyle personal and our relationship with the design . 
important also think in the part of . 
, by therefore , not only physically , but that also is as , by example , of the pages of products in the weeklies ( of subjects specific , as trends , , face , etc ) . 
all this we spoke the and designer . 
all this already is for the sunday . 
has of have a vision global . 
three invited specialists ones the conference of saturday with information on all kind of bodies . 
, the designer of fashionable and the of fashionable . 
we reminded that the fashionable is a illusion and the should from party to this . 
a good know work with a same of certain of forms various . 
is , in this case , fundamental . 
, the such ( or as say in english , ) is can certain to what stale with and , but also serves for certain the body he with shoes of and as if it in reality a clothing . 
well enough and higher the bottleneck for obtain a image completely different . 
&apos; with this &apos; , we stressed . 
that more is the next council : &apos; start to work , ago lack that first all the rules &apos; . 
&apos; already look &apos; , said . 
end i is clear by what all these developments , what is being with what , by what , if then is that in the weeklies of fashionable we are results different . 
without about of the . 
the , know that a has that have more types of clothes in the reserve of the that to . 
, for a history of fashionable that have ten pages ( by therefore , ten ) , there that have hand , lists for use , the least fifteen . 
also that the fine the clothes works in combination with other , all them different to the that is overnight in the reality . 
this there that times in account to the time of solutions the . 
we was that the image and the lifestyle excessive them alone , in many cases , the half of success . 
look to , that not is precisely a struggling extraordinary , but the image and the have fact of she a star world . 
, by the time , not there still a trend clear to use the services of the . 
the eventual famous also what are pointless ( i mere my skills , my aspect physical not has so importance ) . 
when someone we our services , there that have in account that is very likely that we a enormous very different to the their real ( less ) . 
only is and physically if the weeklies of heart already have writing on the issue , if a certain has / , etc 
sunday , and we in that the not you enough in the fashionable , but that has that understand of . 
their work , on all is must communicate with the people to the that , by what that is fundamental be a good fariñas . 
levels to the people , not is ago of least , stand their views . 
&apos; a director you for that you the and is what with fine , not look take and bath-water all what that had and say : &apos; what horror &apos; &apos; . 
&apos; the least a couple of things that and recommend for that someone is the can put &apos; , says . 
same also we was that all must in the so-called &apos; &apos; , is say , the stock of work . 
is set around of the and is have there all the tools necessary . 
items as incomprehension , as incomprehension , , or . also will of ( that you serves the during the session of fine of products such that or ) , special of of by front , if this outside greater ( the and another kind of not are , therefore could damage the fabric ) , or a at of remnant . 
not static in the usual and put something in practice , we learned to the of the shoes . 
during the part-session of fine in the study , in a surface still , is could damage the and much more still the foreign . 
not did more that and . 
could play the shoes with the incomprehension for not by accident . 
that had that be very . 
i has given a joy the who my work without reserves . 
truth is that not is i give very well these skills . 
is only a small part of all the that we heard during all the end of week , in the second part of course . 
i i given account that producing the to level professional not is a way of rose-tinted , but i does exactly as what that telling the people . 
and : is compete by all . 

journey , in principle , is complicates to cause of a series of of a journey routine during the time of morning . 
certain measure is managed cover the expectations , but this not serves of nothing , if , in reality , not is intended do nothing so . 
new over , to the that the title is adds , adherents large expectations already before of their . 
that would new aires to the former of to and and , to as of what shown , is as a at that not should end being other time a gender of action without more . 
we feel by know how disappeared the scenes , where the like main falling of car and around by their own ordinary . 
often happen in the of , the results not an great thing regard to what that we been . 
to that is can give by community , but in the total is some points to cause of failures absurd , that already come in the series since ago years . 
reality not is can or calling errors , but that is is more well of the incomprehensible of the . 
adventure starts very well . 
you introduces in a history , whose leading , , has certain problems personal ; for , is you offers participate in a career illegal by all . 
the in the at east , in , and tardiness.&apos; mission is come the first to . 
idea is offer something interesting . 
route is into in ten stages and , then , in more of fifty to . 
this is follows that every career has place by a route different and the stages are in different environments , that are quite various and interesting . 
that way , one not has or the that of that the at will always what same . 
of the environments are even to the view , although the level technical of is equivalent the of mistreatment previous of the series . 
therefore , not is nothing of another world . 
the own by the desert , the landscape or the highest mountains covered of snow are a effect identity very atmosphere . 
, the to is of time in when by a element . 
, by example , in the desert you a storm of bit that news the visibility . 
change , in the mountains there that have care for that not you a . 
that , every a of the to is very well developed . 
there a couple of models , but with that enough . 
a time , to a amount of rival ( what normal in a career classical ) , after of win time ( duel stale ) and then you expected a duel against a only . 
half of all this is to sometimes the police , that not ago but sent still more the things . 
odysseus are the landscape outside of car . 
have when , in the majority of the cases , has of escape of someone and fine you that , always the fair in the time fair . 
complicated . 
surprising , without however , that has enough least landscape in the at of what that be wait ( in particular there only three ) . 
the result end is positive , because this element not comes to be some and , in the context already mentioned , is one of the elements that do that the at making more interesting . 
model of severe still the fingerprinting of the episodes previous . 
want say that to day of today already not be great thing , but not is can say that be bad . 
a realistic , already look seek in other part . 
to a career office-bound with quite action you be quite this lifestyle of severe , although we find something better between the games of the competition . 
here , all in order . 
the problems arise after of a true time . 
difference of what right of the models of severe , already not happens what same with the crashed . 
games of this kind not is wait that and crashed complicated , but of fact before of a coup against any subject , not look predict how prosecution , with what which not all is in order . 
typical that , the do a very or able the prosecution with a traffic normal , so only has light , but in other situations almost identical , prosecution has doing . 
even has completely destroyed . 
the system of , not arise large problems , but can of bad humour . 
are of such way that , when a accident or you of the back , the at you the last point of rescue in the back . 
however , in every career only is at of five available . 
the all , you that restart the career since the principle . 
therefore not is more that a aid in case of that something not will well , but not is very of . 
sometimes , or the aid , only aid the the stage on of memory . 
great disadvantage of at is that the ourselves facts is themselves in different places . 
some , by example , there that into of a way specific ; of another way , are gone of take . 
sometimes you in some website vehicles &apos; civil &apos; always with the same configuration , although the first , or five minutes before or after . 
ago of on all in situations , when that two that will the i in directions observing , your without problems , but when , or well where . 
as when , because is thing by that the &apos; surprise &apos; always happen front of force . 
opponents have also a advantage more . 
all the starting to websites where , without have in account the time , always you the same in the same website . 
this happens the end of the starting , in a long bridge , what which is still more . 
must come before that fine , the price that be . 
will front of fine , you difficult the vision of the that come of with , so that the principle look do the car . 
can understand the idea of create a at with maximum takes of and , but the execution is so apparent that surely you yes . 
is a worth , because although the model of journey be simple , the at is fun and with action , of way that to often not is possible continue the detail what that is or where . 
really does as , if the merit is has the idea with fifty runs features or the classification in the career for that not the platitude , or any other thing . 
idea is the change of during the to . 
that be vigilant to the of petrol the hand of the road , because exactly there you that change of prosecution , although in the great majority of the cases you suffice what that you . 
is into in three categories . 
sport are suitable for areas urban , the strong american for the motorways and the for a severe technical , by example , by roads of mountain with . 
will main also is a will of challenges parallel , is say , there to in places specific that by the stories . 
not only haul , but also points of experience for profile , that serves therefore for the challenges as the . 
achieve the level higher , the driver is you open several possibilities , beginning by the prosecution and with funds for the profile . 
same time , there a role in line , that preceding results with the of other players and other duties community . 
of the elements more difficult of understand is how is nation the last career in the history . 
the car to the tunnel of metre ( satisfied ) , where you to closing to shameful by the ways ( satisfied ) . 
you mark between 150 and 200 km / h ( satisfied ) and , of suddenly , by behind you comes the of metre and is you has by front without more . 
the significant surely will a discussion on this during several days , on if during the programming of at none was even a little or if the authors of truth we take by a bunch of . 
part technical of at not is nothing so , but the least the effects general are in the majority of the cases , to sometimes to . 
what worth that , in the at more is reduces the quality of image and , in times , of a way serious . 
affects on all to the accidents where there many participants , when the quality of image continual already not is valid . 
audio is well and the such is a question of tastes . 
end of that be of welcome to the greater part of group youth , the such belongs to the category &apos; every one of their father and of their mother &apos; , but is can mean that nobody enlightened the at only by their music . 
that end of and : is therefore quite confused . 
the at errors absolutely questioners , we we problems in say that is the better at of of the last years . 
the that of that the at not is concluded . 
is , but because the errors you back in the eyes with the force of a of airport .

have out the prices of the travel since 1989 
1989 had in the of then only five agencies of travel state no-fly : , , , and . 
agencies of travel of at time in the majority of the cases travel only the bloc socialist , therefore the travel to were very . 
tourists czech would , by therefore , of holiday to the beaches of the ( ) , to the , ( in in the ) to and ( both in the ) and to ( ) . 
exception positive was the period for between 1962 and 1972 , when is could travel to , without however , after the regime is towards the east and the travel of the tourists czech were then quite . 
great somewhat of socialism was the fact that to the citizens of bloc socialist ( or be , also to the ) not is them travel free and processing or even by the countries socialists . 
a citizen wanted travel processing , by example , to or to the , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the journey individual not was possible . 
agencies of journey in those times also travel the , but one is should put to the eu with a together of eye and through so all the night , or have &apos; good known &apos; in the agency . 
so not all was cattle . 
so-called &apos; promise of change &apos; that was the condition for the travel the , not is to the &apos; people politically little reliable &apos; , that so not could travel in all . 
currency not was a currency freely converted and , without guarantee of change , not was possible obtain the resources ( the currency western ) for travel to . 
great majority of the czech experience their holiday in their own country , by what that had a great number of infestation and houses of summer , that the czech . practice still still . 
way of travel of the czech has suffered since 1989 a real revolution . 
that to 1989 for us was the not will more through the holiday in the or , the year last the czech did producing million of travel of holiday to countries of all the world . 
great somewhat , of the that today day already not we aware , the fact of that the destination currently odds-on , , to 1989 not is could travel freely , because was part of the of then . 
principles of the years 90 is imposed the exemption of visa for travel to the neighbours of western , what that resulted a wave huge of visits of short long-term , to or . 
, during much time , not is see of the the , all the world wanted see the what least by a time . 
example , in the groups of czech in the parks in shops of campaign , already that our income of then not we pay a hotel or pension . 
feature typical of the czech of at time was the be for the food ( canned , pieces , etc ) for save . 
time important was the introduction of the of the crown czech , so our tourists could finally , after of decades , buy freely currency western . 
level of life and with he also the wages media , what that around of 1997 resulted a increase in the demand of travel . 
the increase of the demand of travel detected the agencies , to from of 1997 with addressed , to preparation the travel using the adequate of flights , what that was down incredibly the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thank to the possibility of obtain contributions by the volume of passengers . 
end of the 90 of century last , already the czech themselves without visa to almost all the countries developed , exception , what which still more our travel . 
time interesting in the history of tourism happened already in the 2000 , when was organised , thank to a huge demand , the first flight direct since to a country , and was to . 
at year , proceed all the years flights direct with tourists czech was countries distant and . winter already is directly since to 12 destinations . 
countries the akin currently close of 100 thousand czech the year . 
time interesting of this time , that symbolises our development , was in the year 2008 . 
17 of november of 2008 , squeezed the visa for the tourists czech , with what that our country happened to be between the countries more developed of world . 
2008 the czech , by first time in their history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ( % ) and by first time in their history , is have spent in travel the abroad more of 15 thousand billion czech by head , including the expenses in the website of stay . 
for choose the president , that could end of new in point died . 
ago almost five months the football czech is without president and is likely that the successor of as of the of ( ) , not is or after the call of the next that will place this thursday in . 
fact , still not is has come to a agreement on the rules of vote to continue . 
the same , not is will vote even for choose between the three candidates . 
interested to the football czech are , and . 
to their office in june not without before rectify to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that deals of football in the future . 
however , after of conclusion the was , is used a controversy between the two of the partnership unable of come to a agreement for decisions a candidate common . 
became in fact the 16 of september when had that be elected the new president . 
delegates of the is met in vain in the ( ) , on in the area of , because the discussions is had blocked and not only in as the method of election . 
is was to no consensus or in as to who in the had right to vote - only the representatives legal or also the delegates with a powers . 
from of that time and because to this only point , is in a agreement part-time , supported also by the recommendation of of and , according the which the representation by a powers not is possible . 
however , the disputes on the code electoral are open . 
light on the situation already not could should or the that , in their meetings , or extraordinary , all not justic nothing . 
opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of sometimes already , but the point nerve still being the same . 
question is the next : ? of what way proceed in the third round for avoid the point died ? 
&apos; dispute revolves in about to if is must proceed of agreement with the or find another model &apos; , says , one of the three of the , that , since the direction of the partnership , represents the professional . 
the model proposed in the , in the third round going at candidate that have greater percentage of support in the federation to the which will their candidacy . 
of is ready to come to a compromise for that can win at candidate with a greater percentage total of votes in both . 
part bohemia , without however , which the condition of that the winner , according these are , should have the majority of the least two thirds . 
&apos; you , without however , the sense to the two rounds previous and by completely the concept of system &apos; , so is as understand the concerns of the part , according what which what better would not play the order and vote according the files . 
what said , quickly , is of agreement also , although is is that the regulation electoral established by the of all the candidates be more to . 
&apos; like that is the maximum of agreement with the &apos; . 
&apos; that not is no about of the representatives as in the last &apos; , says the cases of , that is by first time as candidate and that us their comments mainly in against of . 
still being positive . 
he , in is decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future of way constructive . 
&apos; the is with the party of today of our team national in the . 
&apos; football will to be leading , and so is more to will &apos; says the representative of , that of the three candidates has more experience in management of football , therefore to level professional as regional . 
is the more reluctant . 
&apos; that is comes to a agreement , but , by unfortunately , the situation is much more very . &apos; 
&apos; is is of conflict between and , but there attempts of the rules to their own convenience . &apos; 
&apos; can have as result a new deadlock of the . &apos; 
&apos; all any , hope that is band the sense common &apos; , said . 
not is much time for that all the parties are to a agreement . 
negotiations had that take in , but ? who can know to that start the party if the team of football will completely ? 
air special , in the that had that travel to , between other the and , not has out this morning by problems technical in , taking that other a alternative for carry to part of committee executive the place where will place the party of classification . 
the meeting decisive , by end , could be the that will place to level ministerial , that , according have , is will this wednesday . 
, minister of , and , you like much integrate to the parties divided to the organisation sports more powerful of country for that is comes to a agreement . 
much in at : the benefits state , the credibility of football and also the next of central of the federation of sport ( ) that big made of a new direction the sport czech after the problems financial of the home of . 
by achieve the presidency , because not is a candidate more appropriate . 
the head of the of , , before of the extraordinary the name of a candidate appropriate that all their ideas on the new president of the of ( ) , or is introduce as candidate to a since so relevant . 
&apos; would a person appropriate , would fighting by she and not i introduce as candidate to the elections . &apos; 
&apos; to the day of today not is has been find a person so &apos; , said for the of ( ) 
that grounds to to into in the challenge with and is exactly the possibility of block to , the course winner of the elections , that opens the way to the presidency of the of ( ) . 
also that , in case through , in the office of president only to 2013 , when ground the time of the house general ordinary . 
that office you like see to a expert and good workforce that not is too related with the events fans . 
&apos; i about with some people to the that could have in account &apos; . 
&apos; me was a madness hear to some say that in this time or even want identify with the football czech . &apos; 
&apos; like change that vision &apos; , adds . 
that supposed more bother to in this time is the relationship of with the of the of of , a man with a last controversial , known outside of as a with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the house general . 
is so unacceptable see to but in the presidential . 
&apos; case of that , is nazarbayev the status existing and nothing in the football will &apos; . 
&apos; the support of , a man of business ambitious , the football rather still least from &apos; , said . 
also the fact of that ago a years the name of was e-commerce with a usual telephone during the research of a case of corruption , of the which went . 
&apos; know what prestige the football could bring the victory of . &apos; 
&apos; with what eyes we plead the and the &apos; , said , that also decision-making with certain caution their declaration previous that &apos; the if is become in president &apos; . 
the case of win the elections of thursday , could be the cooperation with in the future . 
same opinion is the another candidate , , that has been supported by before of the of september that end in a . 
&apos; ( ) would the first the that event &apos; . 
&apos; very capable . &apos; 
&apos; what could imagine , by example , as head of the representation &apos; . 
&apos; but not as workforce of a partnership &apos; . 
&apos; not the there where not i am capable &apos; , added , that in september very attention by support the from of the of by , potential after by . 
accepts that is to manage the partnership . 
to their capacities of management of the companies private , therefore since the summer last is also the of , that with their support took in may the in first division . 
&apos; force for change some things in the area of football and make to their practice safe . &apos; 
&apos; reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that probably tend to influence in the decisions of committee refunded and of appeal , taking situations become , said without so their towards the president of . 
of the priorities also would the of consolidate the relationship between the and the , with the aid of which pressure on the leaders political for that disproportionately more money the sport of the taxes of the announces . 
&apos; one of the problems key the that is should conducting the new president . &apos; 
&apos; the taxes on the games of random , as what the parties political , support their arguments , but , frankly , have that us where will to stop all this money &apos; , out . 
, now not has in account even their partnership with the , although he same says that the of the must be &apos; not an &apos; . 
is to their time e-commerce with and with of . 
&apos; is ideal . &apos; 
&apos; not i sense the fact of yield preach my actions of of to other person for then again there after a year and half &apos; , said . 
promised to the new that with the point died of the elections . 
days before of the of the of one of the candidates to the presidency , , promised that , in case of be elected , effective that the had a new that definitely for right , in the future , the controversy in as the regulation electoral . 
representative of is positive in as to the meeting of this thursday in , and believes that the conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of team of football . 
before of the elections not made in september , promised firstly , in case of be elected , precisely in the representation and in power funds . 
participate in the last minute in the last house general , by what that this until of two months you could go well for defend and it , in a context more broader , their ideas on the management of football . 
&apos; people of all the levels is as of football already ago much time and expected know this thursday the new . &apos; 
&apos; that has come the time of that someone the partnership &apos; , think the man that is couples mainly with the of , but that worked in the and in the committee executive of the . 
this reason , believes have enough experience for manage the football czech . 
convinced that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that hung in the time of . 
&apos; , in the general of june were adopted the that not were so lifts as all ideologically . &apos; 
&apos; certain interpretations , we a president already since september &apos; , emergency . 
the of document more important of the is as for who to the delegates . 
&apos; i president , i what ballot as a challenge personal and i prepared to i in case of that this . &apos; 
&apos; a question of principles , without the which not we there &apos; , says . 
, in theory , is not fight with their opponents . 
in the last had your that is was mercy with , the that respects by their training in , being aware of that their would also their first vice-president . 
was much time without attack to who , the contrary of , not he pawn with head . 
&apos; more of a year in the world of football , and already has achieved some successes . &apos; 
&apos; attacks but were and very people became amazed by the campaign electoral . &apos; 
&apos; that many of them on their real nature &apos; , said to their rosales , that still being faithful to the statements announced already in september . 
weapon more powerful is , according he , their knowledge of football , since the sports more lowest to the with . 
last should be of promotion of football . 
&apos; , right all the that arose to cause of the as result of scandal of corruption of year last . &apos; 
&apos; after i in the negotiations with the sector public and the private , for ensure that has enough money for all the football &apos; , said ago two months to the the candidate of 46 years . 
continuation also promised that their appointment as president of football not no change personal of the . 
&apos; that know first the tasks of every employed &apos; , said wave to where , after a long period of , has a comprehensible . 
despite of the scenarios lack current that is to the next house general , he believes that the delegates not travel in vain this thursday to . 
&apos; the only point of disagreement will how vote in the third round , without doubt what we overcome . 
&apos; football needs credibility , the which is recover only if by end has a leader &apos; , still two days before of the but more decisive in their career of representative , still being positive . 
promises , that under their leadership , the to work with wish . 
in the quarter its elected the current vice-president as new president of the of , very people is and surely . 
promises that , in case of be elected , is hard . 
implemented a change systematic and do that the member of committee executive are responsible of every area of football processing . 
is goal to resolve the case of the , improve the relations with the and the , get more money for the football and continue with the work started by the previous president . 
&apos; president , i like producing by completely the football &apos; . 
&apos; the contacts international with the and the to the selection , and by the football professional or the invariably of young of high performance . &apos; 
&apos; this not i say that what would all only &apos; , said in a interview for the . 
&apos; a player of team and i division the powers of committee executive of such way that every member can who to a area 68 . &apos; 
&apos; tasks difficult for that the football can , in every one of these , continue forward with much momentum &apos; . 
&apos; very people this probably not you , because mean start to work very hard and not only criticise the work of the others &apos; , added . 
to the atmosphere of criticism in the movement , is says that has considered the possibility of not stand of new as candidate . 
&apos; know , that work 20 hours everyday . &apos; 
&apos; need know that this will sense and that not will people behind of my that i clearly and to every step &apos; , he so the reasons of their . 
&apos; people i has said that not i asked by folk , because then is fico by also the others &apos; . 
&apos; is of have faith for not leave so , without more &apos; , said . 
say , you grounds also continue the work that already began with . 
&apos; these two years , is end a great part of work that not i that now is along &apos; . 
&apos; processes that is had started and that will their effect within of a couple of years and not i like that someone the &apos; , announced concerned by the fact of that , if the another candidate , , the situation in the partnership could again to be such as was before of the time of . 
&apos; i in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , not is capable of keep . 
&apos; of he is on all all that people that is of football for that outside only a privileged for a few elected . &apos; 
&apos; i can a lot of things , but not the fact of that i to favour of someone . &apos; 
&apos; be aim . &apos; 
&apos; do a football for all , because only so is well all and not only the elected &apos; , said . 
also the idea that only serious golden the president . 
&apos; some people seeking say what contrary , i in mind do what maximum by . &apos; 
&apos; example , is time of think in the fact of division the second division in a part czech and in other , whose winners to the first division &apos; . 
&apos; is would the situation current in the that we only three equipment of , what that represents a problem for the players young &apos; , said . 
to the of the elections presidential is , president of , not is of believe in their possibilities of be elected . 
&apos; am have a strong support of the , the which i made as their vice-president and that know that behind of me there successes clear &apos; , said , whose successes understand the saving of a tens of million of billion of contracts , the negotiations of contracts and the negotiations on the law of the announces . 
another hand , recognised their part of fault in that the federation not is united . 
while civilized that is &apos; for restore the confidence in the football czech &apos; , as the another contravention , , as a candidate strong that yes has something that offer the football . 
&apos; can for that was a great work by the at year &apos; . 
&apos; the case of that be elected , probably will what that already began and not of way significantly the of personal in the committees . &apos; 
&apos; i use that to my favour &apos; , so to their rival .

first that must necessity the bank since february of 2012 . 
is will office of the presidency of council administrative in may , not to principles of 2013 , as the bank the tuesday . 
is hard for . 
is banker , more well , professor of economy and and has had a period of adjustment surely necessary . 
coup is ago responsible of the strategy of a bank , that has of again to prove that deserves the title &apos; the greater bank of scandal of &apos; since ago time . 
a part , the is huge , to ago little was the greater administrator of goods world , and by other part , since ago years , is of a scandal the next . 
, so what seems , is you the changed so proud bank much . 
the crisis financial . 
had a reputation excellent to 2007 . 
image of administrator of goods much and hardest , but also , is with objectives ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investments . 
a part , with ones billion of dollars , the variety more money of customers wealthiest that any another bank of world . 
by other part , as bank of investments in the league of the large banks of world . 
. 
, the former banker and after professor of in during many years explains : &apos; my students , always i described to the as model of a good bank . &apos; 
&apos; the point of view current , one is question : ? could ? &apos; 
in a great mistake . 
the year 2007 went to the light that something went very bad in the . 
middle of year , , director general , that to then was considered as a banker and very intelligent , resigned quickly . 
months after , is the reason . 
fund of investments of bank is in losses with titles of high risk and had that thousands of million . 
should with this , the announced a of capital of nothing least that of 13 thousand million of frf . 
this found investors , course that some with contempt to little before : a fund state asian and of and a fund state arab , so , that never is had heard their name . 
was only the first coup . 
april of 2008 , . 
bank had that should the loss of thousands of million , , president of council administrative , in 2006 in the second better paid council administrative of , resigned . 
october of 2008 , &apos;you the disaster , in view of their investments wrong , the is found in the crisis financial to the still and had that be by the state . 
bank national values problem to the by many thousands of million , the was six thousands of million of frf by a sensible converted , by the that is in of bank . 
was affected , is stated what dramatic that was this for a country small , if to banks so large . 
the sum of balance of the in 2007 was more of five sometimes greater that the results economic of ( see ) . 
&apos; we again to rescue to the &apos; , said , expert in . 
the first disaster is joined the second . 
months after , the in a conflict tax with and is was ready to drawn the data of the customers wealthiest , that possibly had taxes with aid of bank . 
, whereby a figure of 780 thousands of million of dollars , point of profits of these business with a compensation by payment . 
this , the more or least have helped in the fraud tax . 
lost something that had been since always their capital in the competition by customers rich : the of discretion . 
the scandal , the secret of bank much already not is the same . 
this continued the camara of president of the junta directive and of president of council administrative . 
the emigration of the funds of the customers . 
this way , in few months the bank lost their credibility in their two sectors central : in the of investments by the speculation flawed and in the administration of goods by the aid the fraud tax . 
fair when back to be something more pace , fair when is i that the back to this , is this history of operators , a operators individual 1.7 thousand million of eur , before of that the bank is account of that something was bad . 
is , by what seen , this still not works well with the management of risk in the of investments . 
&apos; the case is world that the controls of risk have changed too little &apos; , says , professor of economy and finance in the of the of . 
director financial of a great bank german also is sure : &apos; problem of the is that not dominates the controls of risk &apos; . 
what that about the idea of the caution , with the that the bankers swiss is were since ago time , be the watch of the elderly goods of world : no risk too large , in change , the security of money want the another hand of the republic contracts . 
concerned of security of the banks swiss were the symbol of the reliability , as and of chocolate genuine . 
central of the in not dovetails with the key of hardest bank private much , only is a little greater . 
situation is classical . 
bank has their headquarters main in the street of , that will since the station main directly the shores of , by the summits covered of snow of the mountains . 
the buildings are , the sells are a of the more higher of . 
is are as between business traditional swiss as the . 
they since ago years the banks swiss : since the bank national , and by the palacio of , to the banks private as . 
enter in the room of reception of the by a disproportionately door swivel . 
the walls are of , front is are large of such , together the logo of bank there a great for indicate the &apos; security &apos; . 
know what that the client search here : . 
two large banks swiss , the and , in some time have the idea of great bank much , or the have betrayed , as view the president of a small bank private much . 
not read their name in the newspaper , the end and the out ago , as all the bankers swiss , also with the business of both large banks . 
is has fact too large , view , mainly in the of investments , where the penal have cattle ground . 
the swiss not had nothing more that say . 
&apos; is have have during much time to the handicap of the penal . &apos; 
fact , the changed the of investments us , handed their first great benefits and then wine the disaster , no entity financial european had lost therefore money in the of high risk as the great bank much . 
15 of october of 2008 , the disaster was clear . 
&apos; wednesday the coalition government of small country of seven million decided the greater operation of rescue in the history of their nation &apos; , says the author in their book &apos; &apos; ( &apos; of the &apos; in spanish ) . 
political 3.8 to 68 thousands of million of frf or approximately 45 thousands of million of eur for save the great bank of the . 
? is them happens ? 
about with the bankers swiss , so are the problem in the dimension of the . 
june of 1998 , two of the three large banks swiss is in a consortium . 
a bank that , because to the merger , was too large for the small , and still growing . 
what that was for that the two different banks precursors of the is : a bank rico but rolls-royce with the centre of the administration of goods in and a more poor but more strong . 
suddenly , the banks of investment came of way be with much money , with the that could do a great bicycle financial . 
two names related with this takes of the : , head of consortium of the of 2001 to 2007 , and , then president of council administrative . 
&apos; i that and were a team perfect &apos; , says the expert in . 
&apos; , the intellectual , modest , that understand much of models and statistics , and , the that managed times step since the learning in the bank to the summit . &apos; 
, is of . 
the end was probably a mistake decisive : &apos; that their models were a reality &apos; , says . 
&apos; a case tragic . &apos; 
, perhaps . 
clear : was before of case . 
employees of the is remember clearly of the meetings of that , in the that , the head of consortium , always the same motto : of ears to . 
bank american was the bank of investment more of world . 
the &apos; &apos; , the that then the success of the banks . 
wanted be in the summit . 
steps you forthcoming well . 
the operations of and in the negotiating of actions was in what more high . 
however , the advisers of companies makers put of highlighted a point weak : the business of interest international , in the language of &apos; &apos; , there a compensation huge for the large banks . 
has in the products american . 
fill these , the started a adventure that almost you costs their existence . 
of growth , therefore the same bank as one of their funds of high risk created in investments american of high risk . 
transformed in a machine powerful for appropriations american and to continuation , certain risks to account own . 
also , as other banks suggestion the during much time . 
&apos; summer of 2007 , as the market estate american was in , the there &apos; , said , expert in . 
large the euphoria , so conducting the fall . 
workforce had that go , already that the attempt of employable was more complicated of what that expecting . 
jobs in the is became in seats and are to the today . 
, who us a great bank , has a work almost impossible . 
find a strategy for a bank , to the that all the models of business are around . 
, expert in banks , has a idea , put end to the of investments , focus in the administration of goods , return to the roots . 
bank not want come so far ( still ) . 
the of investments must reduce much , is clear currently .

&apos; to that we , what that happen first . 
walls have eyes : the researchers you are at in 
of become in the new for of the extreme right in , was simply another kind that their points of view in line . 
monday , , who deed have done a killing in in july , that he 77 dead , is brigades to their first hearing legal public . 
can have action only , was far of be only in the : last the greater part of time that preceded to their attack with to their computer , with some of the million of nationalists that support to the groups of right in networks social . 
of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people . 
, ? how ? 
- only you that into in . 
&apos; we account of that not was so difficult come to them &apos; , says , author main of a report published recently on the populism digital european by the centre of studies british . 
of information personal of is so , says , that the researchers could simply use the tool of advertising for determine their characteristics with a precision scientific - the way that the sellers have state being during years . 
team of found half million of fan of the groups of right in all and then them announcements , but in place of to a new such or product of , the announcements to the users to complete a survey that he on their level education , attitudes towards the violence and the optimism on their own future . 
come to through of , and their colleagues were able of look to more of 000 followers of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 countries european - all without out of the office . 
&apos; a way completely new of do a research &apos; , says . 
of the results not are of all surprising : supporters in line of the groups of right tend to be young , men and by the immigration . 
however , in a kind of issuing , &apos; those that combined their in line with the outside of line are more reasonable , more democratic and least violent that those that is are behind of the screen of computer &apos; . 
work of is only a example of how is is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists . 
of research , researchers doctors and scientists political are being the website for look all , since problems of health to trends social such as is &apos;s in the &apos; like &apos; , messages in the walls and produce of state . 
more of 800 million of users active a average of three parts of content the day , the &apos; of data &apos; of is and a booming of the research , pushing the number of jobs academic with the name of website in the title to almost a 800 % in the last five years . 
some researchers , the beauty of is that you allows look to the people to the that not with a in the street . 
&apos; , when to people of , was very difficult . &apos; 
&apos; that go to through of party , and them never you 10.6 the access &apos; , says . 
&apos; see all that - are to them directly . &apos; 
say that the website could provide a way of identify and address the problems of . 
study recent done by the , of the of and their colleagues , found that the students university that mean of their of in they a risk significantly greater of have problems with the drink that the students that go in silence on the issue . 
suggests that the colleagues of the students , such as the advisers , could control the website and intervene for help to a student that completely too produce of state with their table . 
&apos; saying treat a problem if not what saying &apos; , said , the of and director of of , and of in the of of , said the . 
&apos; found a way of identify children in risk that of another way not would . &apos; 
also is constantly &apos; &apos; to their own population for obtain data . 
of of website has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and the of , the expectation of participation electoral to half of period legislative of 2010 , and a rate of ( mainly being the information to the that is can access - defenders of the freedom digital ago much time that maintain that the website should put to available of other their great amount of data for the research ) . 
however , the users of know that the website them is watching , them whether or not - the by power around the with a friend to thousands of kilometres of distance is allow that the website your information personal . 
? what is when the users of spend to be part of a survey that or even know ? 
that the researchers have guidelines well office on how up their data outside of line , in line is a free for all . 
&apos; i that many of the users have thought even in the fact of that a researchers could be examining their profiles &apos; , says , a todd of of of , on a study of 2006 that was to out with the walls public of of students . 
&apos; what that to them concerned , was only between them and their friends . &apos; 
is the question of the methodology . 
outside of line , not there guarantee of that a issue of research this being completely honest . 
, is impossible know that part of the information of profile of a user and of the messages of wall are truth . 
&apos; that in and what that described outside of are two things completely different &apos; , says . 
by that that , to despite of their years as researchers of the technology , believes that a and a are being the best tools of research that nobody can use . 
&apos; there substitute for into in the world real and about with the people real &apos; , says . 
&apos; research social is is that is on what social - and a lot of what social still is outside of line . &apos; 
&apos; and inhuman : ago their first emergence public in the court 
, the man that be the brain of the two attacks that killed to 77 people in this summer , is has described to yes same as a of the &apos; resistance &apos; during their first emergence public in the court of . 
&apos; a commander military in the movement of resistance norwegian and in the of &apos; , said to a room full with 500 people . 
&apos; am the court , already that received the mandate of the organisations that support the ideology of hatred and because supports the . &apos; 
&apos; the facts but not i thursday guilty . &apos; 
judge was to during that , because &apos; not wanted give to the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that their points of view &apos; . 
the same reason is refused to allow to , that brought a speech writing with early , house to the family of their victims the end of the hearing . 
also issued to the police keep to under custody during 12 weeks more , you faiths the access to the media of communication during four weeks , and said that the authorities should that have a at control on all the visits and the during eight weeks . 
of 30 survivors and family of the victims speakers to the hearing . 
came with the hope of look to to the eyes , other for confirm that is is under key . 
speakers with the aim of move towards the conclusion . 
&apos; that seemed cold and inhuman &apos; , said a of to the station norway . 
&apos; you , but for me was a step forward after of see and hear the suspect . &apos; 
with a suit dark and shirt blue , is remained and professional to what long of the hearing and to the journalists and to the survivors to the eyes when its and went of building . 
despite of the strange notion of of be part of a movement of &apos; resistance &apos; greater , the judge that not is a ill mental , and said that not there evidence of that overtaken with . 
possible that to some them that the attacks of 22 of july unimaginable be labour of a in place of a group of radical . 
that not automatically the pain and the confusion that all a nation still feel . 
&apos; like that existence a monster , but not what seems &apos; , said a family of a victim . 
&apos; much more easy if what existence . &apos; 
7 of the interview delayed of , is show in a theatre this week 
the death of , the 5 of october , there some that what with - the out of the technology as the . 
what that the fan of could find more intend , in a interview to recently to the that is has as advances of a series of special in the elderly markets this week , is how about this mind about of the processes trade and flows of work of the products . 
without doubt a designer , and , but also was a whoever and a of the of flow - a man that thought that many takes &apos; a disease that is in think that a great idea is the 90 by % of work ... &apos; but &apos; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &apos; 
1995 , was developing the series of television of the ( of the ) on the of computer personal , and is laid during more of a time with for a can and rarely conversation . 
that time had last barely 10 years since that had been forced to leave of , and already working turn in their new company it , waiting the adoption popular of .

someone known by the interviews in depth , here seems quickly prepared to forward their relation and strategies trade . 
very . 
four points different to what long of the interview , there large between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 seconds of , where is clearly their thoughts , for precision . 
there at in the that the of its to the surface , where seems because to the questions of , to go more rapid towards the subjects or arguments of greater importance . 
before of the was of , the or the , there something in interview delayed , when what that is that other companies do well and bad , and offers their own vision of future of the it . 
thing is read assessments of the career of , but there something oil and in the that see here , the the on of the greatness . 
has a vision of as can and must be the things . 
much after of all with detail here , was and what was . 
rapid short of seven with of interview delayed : 
how to carry a business : 
&apos; what long of the years in the business , i always he : &apos; &apos; ? what described things ? &apos; and the answers that you give of way are : &apos; , that is only the way as is ago &apos; . 
know by what ago what that ago , in the business nobody think in the things very deeply . 
is what that found . 
has the detail their efforts for simplify the accounting of . 
by the way in is the costs - to often beginning with a &apos; cost standard &apos; that is was to eye of good , and that then is position with a &apos; looks &apos; - developed a factory that that could determine the costs trade the detail . 
the joke the : 
the &apos; &apos; that he same was with - a has that did to the people effectively the company telephone and do so-called to long distance free . 
has writing widely about of has , but the euphoria of here the proceed the as a act of is . 
how he and the box by the use of a telephone public , doing a so-called , and then since a network of to other , while a with the greater amount of satellite possible . 
&apos; the things around of world a average dozen of sometimes and to through of telephone public and back a minute more later the telephone public of the door of the hand &apos; , says with a . 
&apos; young and what that learn was that could build something us ourselves that could control thousands of million of dollars in infrastructure in all the world . &apos; 
two , not knew much , but could build a thing small that could control a thing heralded - was a lesson incredible , and not i that never would there without she . 
continues a joke that he and almost kept , the to through of the in half of the night and through about with the , while was their better imitation of . 
measure that several member of the hierarchy catholic were in half of the night for about with the diplomatic us , the two in fair before of that the outside reawakened for go to answer the telephone . 
of the technology ( and the sale by telephone with ) : 
the age of 12 years , to the hunting of parts of spare for build a of often , suggestion to in the guide telephone and you was a so-called . 
after of their conversation telephone of 20 minutes , managed a employment of summer to time part-time in . 
&apos; was a remarkable influence on me , was the only company that had seen to that age and formed my vision of what that was a company and what well that to their employees . &apos; 
is became after in one of the employees of that dispatching the laboratories of research of the company in , where was &apos; the first computer of table never fact &apos; . 
so large as a systems , had a small screen of , and i of he . 
a journey to as cared and lose the time with that machine and programmes for she . 
the innovation : 
several points of the interview , about about of reinvent new products on the into . 
in their career , already that is he to sell a handful of le basis , you asked a client if could ravines all the team . 
with only 30 days of credit , had that physically the and the over of the alcohol . 
later , while was in , reminds the struggles to the that is brigades in the development of a of computer : 
&apos; agreement of have arguments dramatic ... i that is considered five years &apos; for create a that 300 dollars &apos; , and i and i i outside and found a designer . 
days after , had a that could build by 15 dollars and that was completely reliable . 
the large companies losing force : 
before of that the intertwining of , northern the way in that many leaders of the industry in their vision , and the control of their share of market . 
&apos; that in or , by what that described and best , ? and what ? &apos; 
has the monopoly of the share of market , by what that the company not has more success . 
departments of sales and marketing increase the success , by what that are this class of people the that end by you the companies and the people contagion of the products are of forum for the decision-making of decisions . 
out of the products that was to that position of monopoly is by fault of people that not have the notion of good products bad products - the knowledge of profession necessary . 
is what that happened in ... 
could have of all the industry it . 
have been ten sometimes their size , could have been the of the years 90 ... 
the defeat of the victory . 
the innovation as expression pablo : 
&apos; a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure that the great idea , time and overall . &apos; 
learns much about of the of the same .

detect a lie 
ensure to the headlines more recent we points insulting serious and curse are the deception and the lie in the life daily . 
candidate presidential is occupied accusations of harassment sexual with several women ; every part accused of lie to the other . 
administrators of the of have been accused of by supposed conceal reports that were that a coach of football withdrawn was sexually to children . 
week last , the president french , , was &apos; &apos; with a off open saying the president of , , that the first minister israeli is a principles .

very the myths on the traps in the examinations of the school and the university . 
have given cases in the that the teachers have given the answers of the examinations to the students with the end of be better seen in their assessments of performance . 
that should be what contrary are sending the message of that lie and house are community . 
? deception we are ? 
a day who , the studies show that you can lie in any place of 10 to 200 sometimes . 
sure , many of these lies are lies . 
study was that the unknown three sometimes in the first 10 minutes of . 
lies , or &apos; the traceability of lies &apos; , is a knowing essential that we acquire all , by reasons therefore personal as professionals . 
of be a at of table similar to , by example , , where the aim is : &apos; i &apos; , the detection of deception is a activity of knowledge serious based in data scientists bad during the last six decades in universities that post-election projects of research in depth , especially in and . 
of the results of the research is that the old about of the lie have been . 
yes who to the eyes . 
always , , is or . 
is can conclusion not that the are difficult of detect or simply . 
of lies holds can come to the truth heart about of the structure of the declaration , the , the training of questions and the times . 
several years the scientists on the deception in the thousands and always shining body of knowledge , and was clear that the detection of deception is a technical modern that is easy of learn and aid to ordinary by our complex world - especially if their responsibilities professionals include the procurement , interviews , or the management of negotiations . 
good have the knowing of read well to the others , include feel to will , their own emotion and of way how the paid the others . 
by the research that the more that the , that the men say more &apos; lies win towards yes ourselves &apos; , while that the women say more lies &apos; win towards the others &apos; normally for protect the feelings of someone that the people married least emotionally to their partners that the people that not are married ( but the lies that usually say tend to be &apos; enormous &apos; ) . 
know that if you is insightful as a , the others is least guilty the . 
? know if someone is ? 
, variation the behaviour her of inappropriate . 
is out &apos; create a line of basis &apos; . 
to provide points of reference for measure after the changes . 
the position of inappropriate , and feature blues . 
better that will if someone normally with the ordinary all the time for not do accusations upon when you see the feet in half of the meeting . 
continuation , groups of behaviour dull , and not . 
to these groups of behaviour as signals of alarm , not as test of deception . 
people that con can freeze the part higher of body the treat of remember their history , can events their feet towards the door , towards a exit , change their position of way significantly or a &apos; &apos; that overstating of and change of position a time that all the questions difficult have over . 
often the do see that the interview has over only for seek that . 
passed attention the vocabulary of inappropriate . 
the to the fund and the time last while regarding that their wife murdered was , a search of she to level national . 
people that con also can use a language : &apos; i relations sexual with that woman ... the &apos; or repeat a question difficult fully . 
indicators more common are . 
can use a lot of &apos; language ruled &apos; when says to a question difficult : &apos; ... to say truth ... to what that i is ... to my understand . &apos; 
ago that the answer be a in place of a fact and is to often a signal of vigilant . 
there no formula for detect lies , but develop skills for be the deception is possible . 
skills will the possibilities of who for avoid be by the artists of the opportunities in their lives professionals and personal .

that very good songs and the principle was something under . 
a such by almost three years and never published a to that after of that ( ) . 
many because therefore and what more important is that still we very friends of ( ) and ( ) , that detected in the such with us and when hear a song or i a was i in the incredible person that was and how i was speaking , always was a pleasure go to work , , about of music and and much more . 
a be human surprising and what . 
such national will the committed of open the shows in . 
? true that you know their work , in special , and that by that the for the opening ? 
, the production we sent with several proposals and that was the such that more we pleased , so that we promised of see what that can offer in live and duty be very fun .

many . 
of the first that is i occur are , , , , , ... 
many that could about all the later on the that i crazy . 
? has achieved keep relevant the to despite of not be already a fashionable ? 
that all us always we feel a little of the word . 
i in she , i reminds the gangs that given before , as , , and all the that arose the same time , and , if there importance now , i that is something marvellous because is music that is the worth listen and gangs as are doing now better music that never . 
principle , their music had a content more dark and now is has again more positive . 
? what is must this change ? 
interesting because i that there a couple of songs in the new showing that such time unimaginable more , but also there songs , as or that as as songs very shameful although can sounding a little positive . 
both , when i the , when the i and are songs deeply shameful . 
that when and there some in your life and is lose to a family or a friend , these things start to draw your art and your music and these two songs , without doubt , represent that for me . 
, i that is can be a person happy and still so power do music that be whites .

reference already not was but , with the in the role of . 
these is was to that , in september , the city a an by 16 notice for other many doors of access to . 
door planned to the idea of park , without doubt . 
that or someone to put doors the field . 
question its single : , ? park or mountain ? 
contest , therefore by their face merely as by what that is of reflection on the city is the issue of conversation between all the architects . 
almost already a issue recurrent the that spoil hand when two member of this former untouchables of elected is recognise in a lift . 
this fact does ordinary , exactly , to a of the few between what that opinion three architects , and teachers university , that is have presented . 
, and : the contest is right . 
, after addressed the with low-lying &apos; is ago necessary &apos; discuss on &apos; the with of mountain &apos; , all time that the speech of , the of the premium greens , not is has taken to out . 
&apos; from of the basis of that the park more carry of is the a . 
other things by their great . 
is more complex &apos; , ruling the architect for who the title of &apos; doors of &apos; within a &apos; trap &apos; : not there that think in them &apos; as the to a park , but the of a areas where there that act &apos; . 
, as and with experience in the world , described the proposal of &apos; challenge intellectual &apos; with &apos; some dangers &apos; . 
derivatives of what &apos; uncertain that is today day project the space public &apos; after the experience in the 80 and that had in the area of &apos; their ending of &apos; . 
first fear is the own of a borders on where is can build . 
&apos; something is them already the next step &apos; , is say , their . 
&apos; that think in new instruments , of planning , because the current &apos; in reference the ( ) &apos; can give ordinary to disasters &apos; . 
to the question , view that , , the face of &apos; can should as a park , the of , not &apos; , by a question merely . 
reminds that already there a work fact by the of that &apos; not must fall in together breaking &apos; , although thanks the opportunity that the city offers to their of intervene in this project &apos; since the first time &apos; . 
still more , understand that the of the mountain with the city is the produced that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &apos; doubt &apos; on if is this profile technical the that must lead the equipment ( &apos; all a rightly &apos; , as ) that is have had that create : &apos; architects should be only a tool &apos; . 
nothing that the answer to the question that does title to this piece is complex , because in the foundations of contest lack a vision global of : &apos; have much 16 notice direct in the sense , but not there a reading , that see and understands the area in their whole &apos; . 
from , the least in their case , that has choice by participate in the 16 notice . 
another way , a project for a of the doors can in programme and definition with the of architect of the door of the hand . 
their opinion , that yes , the city should ensure that the strip immediately higher to the of should at , in all their spread , a area of that a &apos;softly transition between the city and what green .

secretary does details of accident air where lost the life the secretary of , , and seven people more 
of and ( ) informed that the results heap on the accident where lost the life the secretary of , , and seven people more , show that the hawk is of way direct on the ground in full integrity structural , without that the pilot could try a landing enforced . 
a conference of press , , secretary of and , mentioned that before of 5.30 the , the pilot discovered that the conditions of climate were the right for fly . 
&apos; elements that seem indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the &apos; . 
informed that the unit was finally for 19 people , by what that had with the necessary for carry the personal . 
, said that in the research made in the area of impact not is the emergence of parts in the ground . 
&apos; a search is actions that not there parts or components of the in another place , the impact is presented of way structural . 
&apos; design of hawk was for 19 passengers , had with suitable for to the passengers . 
ground is a outstanding of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of then . 
the time , the secretary was that is a priority have with the results before possible ; without however , the research can last several months , even could achieve a year . 
their part , , director general of and , was that the time of impact , the hawk of in at of cruise and that this happened in a ground harmonised . 
&apos; information strengthens the of a operation normal of cruise the time of impact &apos; , expressed . 
the conference of press , the want of the , , six element relevant in the research : 
identity : 
to the classifies the flight is was under the rules of flight identity , this means that the must have visibility during the flight and the ground . 
likely : 
in the conditions right the tens , with is the towards the area deeply between the and the of is were ground of to low all . 
: 
likely that by the conditions of the has a area of less raising and greater visibility towards the valley of . 
of impact . 
of impact and the last registration of the of radar line , probably before of impact not there loss of control or at in the very of flight . 
of remains of the in a area reduced : 
information available to the time by mean that the impact happened in a very straight and of hand . 
of of remains of the by mean that the hawk is in the ground in conditions of integrity structural . 
is has outbreaks fact of ceasefire or explosion : 
the website of are are without in the remains of the of some kind of explosion or ceasefire . 
last results of the research show that could have had multiple contacts with the ground . 
the jobs of field is have found parts of the to a raising of 9 thousand 200 feet on the level half of sea , the ground is a outstanding that will since the seven degrees to 30 degrees of then . 
photographs show the sequence in the that expected is to what long of said way . 
information provided elements that seem indicate that the hawk could have had multiple in the ground . 
of the search thorough in a area more wider that the website , around of accident , not is have found parts pieces of the , what that strengthens the presumption of that the impact is presented in conditions of integrity structural . 
is protocol for found gene of obesity 
the a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in specialists of 
of ( ) announced that us a research for be the gene of the obesity in children and young , so-called protocol &apos; of the obesity of the childhood and the adolescence &apos; , that will have with related the obesity . 
a release , the head of the of in of of of , , he that is in-house a team of doctors , nurses , and workers social . 
team is supported by specialists and at of of of ( ) and of of and of ( ) of ( ) . 
the research is taught to participate to the population be or not , come to the units sporting participants of in the of , where is have to out the evidence to the under , all the announces to from of the 8 : a.m. hours . 
that the protocol started in the ( of ) and that since the 8 of october , the activity is has to out in the ( of ) . 
time that is ! the aim of together to 500 or 600 under , the study promoting in the ( southern of ) and finally in the ( the north of ) . 
that the purpose of this research is know the components and the importance of the genetic with regard the development of the obesity and identify in children and young mexican factors of risk for prevent the emergence of diseases disturbed . 
we this 14 of november the of the , that the aim is together to three thousand children and young between six and 14 years of age , with the consent and supervision of their parents , for the implementation of specific on food . 
is them on the activity physical and background of diseases , with the purpose of avoid factors of risk that as disease or recurrent . 
that the announces is them applies to all the participants measurements ( weight , enormous , circumference of ) , decision-making of pressure pressure , determination of the levels of , , and insulin and genetic ( is search identify genes that is to the obesity child ) . 
pointed that this research attack to the concern of the professionals of the health by the alarming increase of weight in the under . 
&apos; surveys of health of 1999 and 2006 signal that in so only six years there a increase , in the case of the children , of 77 by % in obesity , and of the girls of 47 by % ; in terms of obesity also is observed a rise dramatic &apos; , preparing the specialist of . 
that the justification for the search of the is in that the population of country from of other by their history genetic . 
that in average , the mexican has 65 by % of inheritance indian american , 30 by % european and five by % africa and this condition is reflects in the genes that is associate to disease and too of weight . 
that of way general , the genetic of the obesity is arising in the inability of bath the too of energy that ( lowcalorie ) and that is transported in way of blubber . 
researchers he that the benefit direct for the participants is the assessment set of the children , what that allows detect if have some degree of obesity or obesity . 
, said , the presence of of colour ( ) in bottleneck and , that show the likelihood of that and to . 
information is &apos; of way confidential , the doctors the by writing to the parents , to who is them explains every a of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle of life that must to for prevent diseases . 
he that there three components main that cause obesity , obesity and other : the , that is the lack of activity physical daily , remain the greater part of day but with the television and use media of transport in place of with distances planes . 
is must to the high , is say , the greater consumption of alcohol , of ( , bread , , hamburger , etc ) with high content in tallow and chickens and the genetic that is analysing in this protocol . 
of the bumpy 
, researchers of the of of the , develops modified with for produce a mixed with better every , regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature 
the signals that middle the like met , not would necessary close of 200 thousand bumpy every season of occurred in the of of , emergency , researchers of the of ( ) of the , who was that if the process of construction and peacekeeping of a is the appropriate , the bumpy could radioactivity in amount or , even , taken by completely . 
their conference opinion technological of the bumpy , in the framework of of the , was to know that the laboratory to their office develops modified with for produce a mixed with characteristics like to the of tried , but with a greater resistance set-up , therefore to highest as to lowest temperatures . 
that this kind of modified could used in places where the climate is extremely a , as some cities of north of country , for improve their every and , by what therefore , the training of bumpy . 
that the tried , the part more disproportionately of oil , is a whole of of , a of high weight , so-called , and other of under weight , so-called , that institutes you give the their characteristic behaviour . 
behaviour of tried is in that to highest temperatures , close of the u-turn degrees , is means as a liquid-fuel , to 120 degrees degree their is very high and to 50 degrees degree is a state almost hardest , while that to temperatures very lowest , the tried is again , added . 
previous means that in the streets the resistance of tried not is uniform , but that is will constitutes during the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , emergency the specialist in engineering chemistry . 
researchers of the observed that the streets of the of in their majority are covered by flexible , the which is consists of six ground of materials , of the which the last three the tried . 
the ground more is is the , by small stones in tried and then . 
a of the that is the , pointed , is with tried . 
the vehicles and efforts , this allows that the forces is distributing very well in the . 
is like of tried amended is still better , opinion the draughtsman chemical . 
the , , is put a last layer so-called of , the which is nation of a material of stone fine , is say , a bit that also is in tried . 
is is of the layer that will to be in contact with the of the vehicles , must have more force set-up that the and provide in the way . 
be the part of that will to receive and salvage the efforts , the of required , also , have the thick appropriate and is must after the material of that is nation . 
climate , especially the moisture and the currencies of temperature , also are a factor very important to consider , in special the water , said , because affects significantly the every of the . 
the ground is , the water is disseminate in the internal of the and is difficult that from , this results a of all the ground of and , by what therefore , the training of bumpy . 
the process of training of a , said , the first in is the film of and only after is affects the , but the damage not happens , but that is a process that should to the first signals with suitable programmes of peacekeeping . 
also member of of he that the burden is another factor important in the training of bumpy and , by this , the thick of every a of the ground of must go always in relationship with the burden and ensure that is ! , for avoid that is train bumpy emotionally . 
emergency that still there much that with and work on the tried , by example , the , that in other countries already is are even in the market and by the bumpy with easily and without need of use highest temperatures . 
? you latter to the candidate of for be the new ? 
of the factors that for that not the crown of . 
, their title number 14 of princess . 
new the of is is with the wish of the crown of . 
time is had that shaping with be in the of , the crown of silver and the such that the as new princess of . 
the result obtained in , where the is with the crown and the , the department already sum 14 titles of and is a to the legion of women that have state close of the crown but that were between them ( dalmatian ) , ( ) , ( 1979 ) , ( 1981 ) , ( 1983 ) , ( 1987 ) , ( 1988 ) , ( 1989 ) , ( 1990 ) , ( 1993 ) , ( 2000 ) , ( 2007 ) , ( 2008 ) . 
the great question that many is do is ? latter ? 
the result represents the defeat of a great that in every presentation proved that she had all for be the new , not in vain was elected of the and of , titles that able as or who is were the crown of . 
first factor that is as key in the decision that took the jury of dates in that not with their answer to the question &apos; ? is that book that you has some to you and by what ? nation by , of the . 
the replied : 
&apos; much , i quite in the literature , i that is a way of , definitely i that the book that i cause of childhood is &apos; &apos; , is a book quite their . 
read &apos; and punishment &apos; , is a book of literature universal that all we read ; and today in day i read the book of , a russian , a book that is out &apos; of the blood &apos; &apos; . 
answer that little pleased first by the term &apos; &apos; and second by not explain of way particular of what way every one of the books that the have some . 
the conclude the ceremony itself you relaxed and happy with the result &apos; the universe is is what that has that through . 
for all the people , by favour read a , &apos; &apos; is a great book &apos; 
the voyager is says that to the the . 
journalist that the be the theories , the and the candidate that is was all the awarding provide ( challenge of , vote of public by the better suit notions , and ) , &apos; that adherents the of the other assure , to the as and by that not in the stage &apos; . 
that is in their first presentation in suit of bathing in the a of and their two in the have of . 
in both safe , is that you missing the force and the impetus that the representatives of and yes presevo . 
, journalist of programme &apos; in home &apos; , of opinion that the fact of that outside abroad princess &apos; apparent that the candidate that more awarding earns during the contest not is as as &apos; . 
, is was to what last very with the press , and there is . 
is that not not convince the jury on their interest towards the work social , that is in last , the essence of of . 
something , two days before of the election the jury international itself that them a woman with the needs social of their . 
&apos; beauty single not enough in a , there that look region beyond of what physical and firstly in their sensitivity social , that before of membership the are already in projects &apos; , he . 
is that by their flaws in the and the that is you in their , but is coming therefore precisely the jury the made as the candidate &apos; natural &apos; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical responsible . 
of recognised that not had the better body , that had best , &apos; but their problem of in the , that the truth for my not was very , you struggle points in the last day &apos; . 
therefore the journalist , of the magazine as that the mistake of the were the speeches that is . 
&apos; are well , but not is the it do . 
body never was their strong and here is the &apos; . 
this prize , that by first time over the of the , after of belonging in suit of bathing about a humane that is whole , therefore is said that this was the that you to for not should the will of the crown . 
or not , what true is that since today starts a year of , not as sovereign , but as princess , position that you offered the possibility of represent to in one of the international by designation of own . 
however , she will to the history as a of the that to despite of their step by , you was the crown . 
was the work of that designated the of 
of happened to the history as the man that this the death of &apos; &apos; . 
work of these officials is key . 
last 4 of november a of of happened to the history as the man that this the identity of maximum head of the : &apos; &apos; , to through of of their fingerprinting digital . 
the seven that in the of , that week you the time of &apos; availability &apos; to , a man of that has 21 years working in the area of research legal . 
an their career , worked in municipalities of , where many sometimes had that by more of five days in the jungle for come the website in the that were the bodies that be be at . 
the 2000 is found to the capital of and , then of to the courses appropriate , is in , that is the study of the fur of , is say , of the of the hands and of the feet . 
week of operational against to you leading that bring clothes minimum for three days . 
large you than . 
friday in the night went for the in a hawk since . 
that should identify two bodies and that is that one of them was of man that respected to the more former of world , by what that you allow that bring the card of ( their real name ) . 
however , when was with the team of research the website in the that is was the not what recognised by their aspect physical , therefore was very different the that had seen in the media of communication . 
without , clothing as a plead of the area , without glasses and much more slip . 
the fingerprinting not . 
of a , ink , a and a , the from fingerprints of with the of the card . 
eye not you : was &apos; &apos; . 
same night , the man of was the responsibility of the minister of , , that yes is was of maximum head of the . 
search of the left 
a of the of the recognition that was the president to , in the wheel of press by the operational against &apos; &apos; , is very significant . 
people not known our work . 
is a science accurate , without for of mistake , that can come to be key in the resolution of crimes . 
of the identification of bodies , the support research by crimes as and murder and bear the identity of the people . 
is aliens , many criminals have thinking or not have papers . 
them we the impression and the look in the basis of data . 
researchers deputies that , in a case of , you validity a part of wall of a home , therefore in that place the principles had supported their hand for from a box strong full of and money . 
&apos; walls are difficult because not are land for from a impression , but in that case we obtain the left of all the hand and identify the criminal , that had participated in different &apos; , reminded . 
fingerprinting also can seeking or reaffirm suspected in cases of murder . 
little found to a man died , with wise of to their around . 
half of the research is that a family could be suspect of crime and , indeed , a left in the bottleneck . 
this not does that has been the murderer , yes what in the scene of crime . 
of he that in the items &apos; the fingerprinting is with chemical or physical &apos; . 
officer , is used a or tape for . 
of this , the from are settlement to the , that is the basis of data , or to the . 
&apos; problem is that still there many dead-end papers &apos; , house the expert of . 
that not all is as is shows in the programme of television . 
as not all what that democratic is gold , not all what that is is is again left . 
however , if can be , if is for the enjoy . 
&apos; &apos; defy to authorities in 
of demonstrators is whom to the square for . 
great part the order of and is found to a near . 
those of movement this tuesday to the authorities of the treat of into of new , under the under of a order legal , to the square of of where were of i and the treat of should another park of the . 
of demonstrators is whom to the square , where wanted access thank to a order legal that allows to the &apos; &apos; again to in the place , while that other part of movement replied the may a park more the north of the city , where has there new arrests . 
&apos; idea is that , if the court not we allows again to in the square , we we to on in some another place and the battle legal by again to , so as to through of tables and demonstrations peaceful &apos; , said one of the for of movement &apos; &apos; , . 
that the answer of the &apos; &apos; the of their camp partly personally by the mayor of , , was to the courts , where the issued a order that the evacuation of place and did to the demonstrators to be . 
, the &apos; &apos; to the occupation of a new park it in the of the and the , very close of the entry the tunnel , that unite and , and property of the used of . 
least during a time intruder should the place , but after the turned and 17,900 to stop to some of the demonstrators , although not could confirm the figure concrete , while was to that was to several journalists that were also . 
organisation will that are several hundreds of people the that is had installed in that point , where already is has a delegation of leaders religious in shows of support to the those of movement and that has treaty of with the . 
therefore , the square - is a of property still closed to the expected of the since of a view legal measures for this same tuesday in the that is must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this i . 
of the demonstrators idps to there and to these hours copies of that order legal and even the to the players that the square , what that resulted &apos; some small clashes &apos; , house , who deplored that some official coups to the demonstrators . 
order legal came to the authorities to the member of or apply &apos; laws that is after of that mismanage the occupation or ban to the demonstrators access of new the park with shops or other properties that using before &apos; . 
mayor house to the press that , because to that order legal , the city had suspended the of space the public and to the demonstrators , to the that alerted , without however , that the laws local not them by their to on with shops of campaign and besides of eye . 
for personally the taken to out of i of the square , a operation in the that is 17,900 to around of 200 arrests and that is decided because the demonstrators were &apos; violations the law &apos; . 
he that was the order of the square because this is was becoming &apos; in a place in the that the people not to protest , but to all the laws and , in some cases , to do damage to other people &apos; , already that &apos; some business received threats &apos; and the neighbours &apos; by their quality of life &apos; . 
&apos; of this i was and shows that in the fund is more interested in preserving the interests financial that the of the workers americans &apos; , added the spokesman of movement , who was the mayor of &apos; the respect to the freedom of expression &apos; . 
responsible of &apos; &apos; also that think organise &apos; large actions &apos; for the thursday in cooperation with organisations community and trade , for commemorate the two months that bladder the protests , that started the 17 of september .

after the earthquake 
overall a 1.5 % thank the consumption share and being end to the spiral of that set in march 
the last month of march the economy japanese is was paralysed , still by the devastating earthquake that addendum in a crisis nuclear , the worst disaster that the country since the . 
first estimates of of the losses materials in 300 million of dollars , a coup that , despite the difficult context world , seems have . 
of three quarters of , the fact of between july and september was for through indeed , definitely : the is a 1.5 % in compared with the quarter previous and a 6 % in rate . 
reported in the second quarter - for the japanese , the year tax begins in march of 2012 - is , also , the greater pace of growth since the period of january to march of 2010 . 
recovery is explains , in part , by the of the buying of machinery for restored the areas by the and the after tsunami . 
fact , the companies by their investments in a 1.1 % , with the declining of % in expenses of capital that is observed of january to march , the first been after of six months of hikes . 
however , the real of the economy japanese not is on exclusively in the momentum deal that taught to take the crisis for strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure , of the shortcomings for grow since zero . 
has reawakened , on all , thank to the development of consumption share , that in the today represents the 60 % of . 
looks a 1 % , by the increase of expenditure in vehicles , travel and activities of leisure . 
stigma of 
is has the market internal , when the - the currency - is has become in one of the &apos; values refuge &apos; by the investors that withdrawing of the crisis of debt in the area euro and the shady forecasts of , a privileged that overvalued as a in the accounts of the companies . 
a motto more strong , the products are more expensive in the abroad , a seriously precisely for a country whose line of economic next certain by the health of the large groups technological . 
or , by example , their weak results between july and september to the prices of . 
the markets are with their to the countries inner-city of the , the of not low the on-call . 
&apos; that be vigilant to the risks that massive , as the deterioration of some economies foreign , the impact of the floods of and the fast opinion of &apos; , pointed yesterday the secretary of of , . 
, in effect , the prospects not are encouraging . 
for the and the ( ) that the majority of the countries member tabled in september signs more of weak economic . 
indicator that the points of turning in the economy world that of highlighted that the main powers is are . 
that struggle four to the points , with to the of august . 
area euro , even , is by below of the average , that is is in the level 100 , the eight to the points . 
again to which the doubt 
says that is the adjustments , but the conservatives not no compromise writing 
the raw of risk peripheral and the uncertainty in the , still in the that leads towards the exit of the great crisis of debt european . 
that of that the &apos; consensus &apos; of new of transition next more tax by the demands of that by a genuine others of the forces policies begins to permanently with facts . 
the new first minister , , yesterday that not there alternative for the reforms structural and that the period of hundred days agreed in their designation perhaps is be short for implement , the leader of party conservative , , that not new measures of austerity in no case and their demand of new elections for the date measures , the 19 of february . 
&apos; main task of this is apply the decisions of the summit of 26 of october &apos; , the open yesterday a debate parliamentary that at morning with a vote of confidence the new . 
package with 24 programmes for promote the employment , the reform of code refunded of the officials and new measures against the evasion tax will the first initiatives . 
however , the message of not the doubt on their position : &apos; we committed to help the of transition , but not we we committed to nothing more &apos; . 
leader conservative was a more far in their to the and the , the bodies that must the million that needs with urgent , and he clear that not will their seen good to no letter of compromise of get of the adjustments . 
the , still by the impact caused by the of referendum of , yesterday that their demand is firm : not the aid if the new and the leaders of the main parties not &apos; a compromise writing without ambiguity and what before possible &apos; . 
spokesman of , , he that the inspectors of the urged &apos; very soon &apos; to for be with the new &apos; what that is needs for pay the sixth by &apos; of million , although not there date final .

the delegates , so only is crimes nine votes in against and ten . 
of several minutes that is , with their speeches , and , after several hours , , the of , any doubt possible . 
idea key of the , and of the motion , is short in a motto : the answer to the crisis &apos; not is least , but more &apos; . 
only because is the peace , but also because &apos; nine million of jobs on directly of euro &apos; . 
the , &apos; has come the time of open way in &apos; . 
could votes in amendments of of for allow strengthen the control of the on the policies budgetary of the countries of the area of euro , although also could in the election of of the by suffrage universal for &apos; should a face to &apos; . 
all case , that is a of the proposals of the motion adopted by the , clearly idea of . 
doubt , is little likely that the 27 are quickly to a agreement on this change radical : is shows hostile to he and the leaders of the seem know that also . 
the providing is on the ground . 
another hand , the delegates have rejected by a majority won the proposal of the weight of every country of the directive of in role of weight of every economy , what which obviously the weight of . 
by the encouraged in the internal of their party , the has increased the no to and . not is that has tried who to their congress to at of the &apos; small &apos; countries european or of the countries in difficulties prepared to criticise to the arrogant . 
the motion on spins a paragraph to the importance of &apos; the friendship &apos; , not has to .

impact of fraud in the lowest by disease 
the benefits , the and the a for against the lowest by disease . 
will the tuesday 15 of november in for visit a box responsible of the benefits family and pronounce a speech on the issue , already recurrent since 2007 , of the fight against the fraud social and the . 
, for - such for , that part of the will of save of way thorough , but still so reminds to a &apos;s of the campaign presidential of right , the majority want firstly in the lowest by disease . 
first place , for apply cuts budgetary : the no impose to the workers of sector private a fourth day of we before of power take the low . 
final , unless that there a convention of company specific , a worker that ill lose four days of wage , is say , a minimum of 15 % of their income month . 
is of a measure that could its a wave of ira , but that would save million of eur , according . 
, would accompanied of other measure with a reach more symbolic : impose to the officials a day of we without remains in case of low labour ( to the time , not have we , with to the three days that is apply in the sector private ) . 
is these issues , the majority again to put on the table also the issue of fraud , this time looking towards the abuses of the lowest working . 
&apos; to significantly the controls and , also , if is which to someone planned a fraud , must the &apos; , emergency talking in the the sunday 13 of november . 
as that in the other cases , the effects of announcement seem slightly for the reality of fraud in on of lowest working . 
fact , since 2002 is for a monitoring constant of this question and is have it various offensive policies that , normally , have given emerged . 
french not more that in the rest of . 
with attention , in first place , the figures national . 
the french of the security social ( ) , in 2006 is more of million of eur in particular by lowest working . 
the french of research and background in economy of the health , the benefits by the lowest , in 2008 , the 5 % of expenditure health , to million of eur . 
this sum , the 46 % is to the lowest by leave and by accidents working , while that the 54 % is related with the lowest by disease , figure that out to million of eur . 
therefore , the 2.5 % of expenditure in health . 
2010 , the french have a average of days of low labour , with to in 2009 , according a study of group . 
average that , without doubt , behind non-availability : other survey , published in 2007 by the syrian of management professional , that the 75 % of the workers french rushing that not had or a only day of low by disease . 
study , in this case of the , points that in 2010 the 37 % of the lowest by disease had a long-term than to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more extended . 
the compared with our neighbours european , the workers french not are more that in other areas to take lowest by disease . 
long study done in 2010 by two researchers of top that , between 1994 and 2001 , the rate of lack global of work ( therefore by reasons of health as of another kind ) , in , between the 10 % and the 11 % , with to a 20 % and a 28 % in , a 15 % in or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the . 
fraud in the lowest by disease not is especially significant in compared with the work not declared . 
fraud has a reach quite limited . 
forward of the legislation , since 2002 , has caused that the controls of the lowest by disease of more of 45 days are . 
2008 , of 1.5 million of inspections , the , in a 13 % of the by , that the lowest of short long-term were &apos; unjustified or too we &apos; , is say , cases . 
the case of the lowest of more of 45 days , untreated to inspections , is was that the 11 % of the cases were &apos; rightly or ; a figure that , taking as starting a total of 1.2 million , out to . 
therefore , is than a total of cases &apos; &apos; between several million of workers that a low by disease . 
doubt , a figure minor in compared , by example , with the work in black . 
the member of the , author of a report on this question in june , this practice personal a losses of income tax of between and 15 million of eur the year , is say , more that the cost total of the benefits by lowest and , without doubt , significantly more that the fraud in this last area .

head of future italian , , has asked time to the markets for improve the situation in , that at the risk of with the weight of their debt . 
new greek , by their part has previous that the implementation of the decisions taken in the of the area of euro the 27 of october would the &apos; work main &apos; of their . 
is is in the point of beggar of the markets , while that the sunday is couple there the elections legislative . 
difference of the types ( &apos; &apos; ) between the obligations to 10 years in and , has reached a new maximum historic . 
the expected of the figures of growth of the area of euro 
the point of view while , has reported a growth economic of mere % in the third quarter , is say , a figure more favourable that the % be , by the consumption share . 
, without however , has revised to the low the figure of second quarter , with a reduction of % of product internal gross ( ) in place of a extends . 
, the fourth quarter is the that really concerned to the economists . 
, by their part , has reported a growth of 0.5 % in the same period . 
out the first forecasts for the whole of the area of euro to the 11 hours , after of that the has having on the risk of a new recession . 
energy : 
the facts must assert more that the undistorted 
there a issue that not is can treat taking in account considerations of short long-term or simply thinking in the emotion , is the policy energy . 
availability and the cost of the electricity impact directly in the power purchasing and in the competitiveness of the companies . 
appropriate that a i electoral be the time of think on such issues and on the place of the energy nuclear . 
debate only will useful if investigated the whole of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the options proposals . 
french must resorted their opinion in facts objectives , in data rational . 
that we million of people in the planet , the development demographic plus the duplication of the demand we before of 2050 , to least that is to a huge part of the population world of a element vital . 
same time , will that admittedly the shortage every time greater of the resources fossil for continue taking electricity continually , without forget the need of reduce the emissions of gases of effect greenhouse for fight against the change climate , a issue that has disappeared of debate ecological . 
accident of not change none of these parameters . 
that , away single in their decision of up to the energy nuclear . 
not is the case or of , that hearing the their to the need of find a source capable of , or of , that only has by aim build central of last generation . 
another hand , , , , , , , , , and , by quote some examples , are forward with determination with their projects . 
, by their hand , after determination add a unit to their park , the construction of a central after the accident of . 
the model german , based in the energy renewable , is is in times as example , the reality will in against of such speech . 
election of will to mean a of price of the electricity , a greater on energy by the need of gas imported , in particular of , a increase of the emissions of by the construction of central of gas and of coal . 
a months , is the effects harmful . 
on the case of . 
of in the sector , of which this the 30 % of their electricity , also is one of the large users of coal and of gas because to the of wind ; by this reason , their emissions of and the price of their electricity are , respectively , a 65 % and a 50 % more high that the average european . 
the contrary , thank to the have of our policy energy , our neighbours a bill of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the who french . 
that in a economy restructurings the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee of peacekeeping of the usefulness industrial in the territory national , the companies french is benefit of the electricity more cheap of . 
that reason , any reduction significantly of the energy nuclear eye a strong takes of price of the electricity , what that realism to the statements on the of our country and the defence of our power purchasing . 
is of a price that the great majority of the french is refuse to pay and , of fact , not opposition by principle to that kind of energy , according show the surveys . 
that the policy energy of our country has lost build a sector industrial with jobs of work director and jobs . 
looking to the export , ways a galaxy of specialist in the markets international and that can create jobs not . 
leave the energy nuclear , eye the of great part of these and the loss of the 6 million of eur year in exports french of equipment and services nuclear . 
? a designed for work sixty years , when is be the collapse of their manufacturer ? 
right the equation of the energy nuclear , there that admit that not there a source miracle of production of electricity , the as that not there a source . 
development by part of of solutions with lowest emissions of , nuclear and renewable , shows the nature complement of the sources of energy . 
the case of the energy nuclear , is essential keep the maximum level of security . 
, have of a of security that has a control at and transparent therefore on the central existing as on the construction of . 
equipment , of recognised professionalism , are also obsessed by the security . 
half century , the sector nuclear has suffered three accidents serious . 
only one , the of , is in in a conditions operational normal ; not resulted consequences or for the people or for the half environment . 
, the accident is due the design of reactor and to a failures human . 
, some people seem forget that the accident is due to two disasters natural of a reach without unprecedented , that wave the death of tens of thousands of people . 
sector nuclear of this accident , such as what was of the two previous . 
to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the operators and arrangements french and germans , the is a design capable of to such phenomena . 
what all the players afraid that want build a central , the reminded of their construction in would a great gift for the competitors of and , since that them commodities way free for taking the leadership in the inevitable development of sector nuclear . 
essential and legitimate seek the best options for our country , but would irresponsible stop that the statehood , the undistorted and the refer a debate so important for the situation economic , social and financial of our country . 
immigration , ? a burden or a opportunity for the economy ? 
policy of immigration roundly by has been on since various points of view : the of the services police , judicial and administrative subject to the policy of figures , the compatibility of this policy with the statute of &apos; country of the rights human &apos; of . 
recently , is the harassment administrative of the students foreign the that has to the headlines , with the of ( the newspaper of 23 of may ) of last that &apos; not needs foreign , workers or &apos; . 
however , rarely time is analysing since the point of view economic . 
question is that , on this issue , there quite consensus between the left and the right . 
the case of the right , the it in 1976 that &apos; unemployed not should be a problem for a country that account with close of two million of workers immigrants &apos; , while that in the left , the besides what that &apos; not can done office of all the misery of world &apos; in 1990 . 
only difference , the degree of generosity 
2005 , therefore the left as the right the fear to the invasion of territory national by a a of poles . 
both both , is as that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society french . 
only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that act with regard to the immigrants . 
their programme , is limited to include , those that the will right the &apos; problem of the migration &apos; . 
idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , perhaps is currently , but economically its very for . 
as guarding the economists and in a labour recent that sums the knowledge more recent on the immigration ( : and , may of 2011 , , . ) , there a broader consensus between the specialists on the impact positive of the flows migratory in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that receive immigrants . 
- of the immigration in the growth and particularly the employment . 
fears related with the impact of the immigrants is based in the idea of that these can replace to the workers national , in particular to the little qualified , recognised for that is reduce their wages . 
the experience shows that , in reality , the immigrants are more well commission that substitutes of the workers national and use mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment . 
immigrants little qualified working in sectors that not by to workers national and the more qualified in sectors enjoy where the training not is the demand of personal . 
effect positive on the wages 
same way that a surgeon would difficulties for work in a country that have lack of , the between national and immigrants from that the arrival of these last anything welcome in the wages and the employment of the national . 
in account what previous , that a increase of 1 % of the flows migratory is a takes of the wages real to long long-term of between a and a % . 
, without have in account the fact of that the diversity that the immigrants towards to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ( there a great proportion of awarding americans and companies as , , , and were considerable by immigrants ) . 
immigrants also are taxpayers contributors to the systems social , since that of average a 1 % of budget total in the countries european . 
of estimated , by example , that in a immigrant that comes with a age of 30 years operators a contribution ( income least expenses ) of eur to the budgets public of average during all their life . 
principle of their mandate , wanted go to seek the points of growth that you &apos; with the european &apos; . 
european , that to the immigrants , had exactly the effect salem . 
invented the democracy , only you lack think in a democracy european 
democracy is a well precious , but also fragile . 
continent european should power of this already that , although is invented in ago more of two thousand years , to what long of century has suffered the tragedies of the , , the , the exalted , but also to in , to in , the in . 
perhaps up that , for that the democracy definitely on their enemies , would enough exercise the vote and of way more direct possible . 
, since &apos; the &apos; , that is was of something thought . 
suffrage universal , although is is of a condition necessary for the democracy , not is enough by yes only and even can become in a &apos; instrument of oppression &apos; , as said home the . 
, the democracy required much more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , , solidarity economic and social , justice . 
crisis that live in is a crisis economic , but is to point of become in a crisis policy and democratic . 
of referendum greek had , to this regard , a double effect intend : was the need of a return take of the sphere policy , but also the worrying that of their alternatively , of their inconsistency . 
on this ambivalence for . 
truth is that the lines of with of the battle democratic currently is have and that , in many cases , the soldiers republicans already not making in the good sense . 
gaining if we a starting of referenda national , organised in role of the needs and of way . 
signing in white the european all or a high the we of hole : ! what options for the citizen ! 
, not want from coups of effect , but a exercise common , of plenary right , pace and beside , of the options and the democracy , this time to level european . 
there crisis in , , , ( of fact , not where end the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of . 
whole of is the that is to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that the that unaccompanied their powerlessness and their lack of solidarity . 
the whole of the that suffering a humiliation in the sphere international . 
preaching by the transfer of sovereignty to , but is all the that lose slowly the sovereignty and , with she , every a of their nations . 
more urgent is that the sovereignty popular unparalleled the expectations of project european . 
only together will the european reduce the weight of their debts , shake of the markets and preparation their future by the investments . 
exit of the crisis stop decisions to level european that not will issue without a legitimacy democratic total , unless that be for the disaster . 
have fought during much time against this proposal of the socialists and of , all the world calls in the today a governance economic european . 
so be . 
think in she without a greater integration policy and democratic , and without that be as such by the citizens , would a new madness and we would to a new point died . 
taking a new stage of the construction european . 
build the in , was be &apos; do &apos; republicans . 
motivated by interests not would enough . 
lesson still being applies . 
build a more integrated since the point of view economic . 
is will achieve build a more democratic in the level political , a real sovereignty popular european . 
build , us european .

, new door of entry of gas russian in 
pipeline , that directly western with and by the fund of , already is has since in service . 
supply gas for satisfy the needs of thirty million of who . 
, the heralded russian of gas , has wanted so the event with great . 
last tuesday , more of 500 invited , including four of and of , took to on of , between the music of the and a delicate , in the opening of , the new pipeline that directly , under the sea , with . 
, the german , the russian , the french and their counterpart of the , , have together the of the that controls the entry of gas russian in the network of western . 
this new pipeline , every year that million of metres accumulation of gas russian additional to western to through of a first had of km that the region of with the of . 
second should to end of 2012 that will supply a total of million of metres accumulation of gas , is say , enough for cover all the consumption french . 
, already is about of the possibility of build a third by the same way . 
, the completion to time of this huge labour is aires of victory . 
and the countries baltic is had theories strongly the project . 
fact , the will to allow supply gas directly to , any the course earth by third countries ( and ) . 
coup , these two countries some something of their power : for them , will more difficult influence in with the access to the markets of western . 
the point of debate , not in for the as a &apos; new pact &apos; , in reference to the alliance between and for should in . 
say , if the issue is politically delicate . 
western , support the project russian , has obtained a greater security of supply . 
the price is a weakening of the of the energy , given that the project has led a gap between the european of this and of east . 
has known , in so only five years , do their vision of a alliance direct between and the countries western rich , large consumers of gas and with a reserves every time more limited . 
&apos; pipeline is a component of our partnership with , a new that we unite of way result &apos; , this during the opening of pipeline , proving to what point the large contracts of sector of gas are so political as economic . 
this explains the broad grins in the sides of the that of , many in , in the point of arrival of gas . 
construction of this pipeline also is a achievement technical . 
is made of steel of rebuild for against the of the ships . 
supports in the fund of sea , to a average of 200 cost-benefit of depth . 
, was necessary avoid camps of mines that rim of the . 
&apos; necessary with or destroy a of them , by caution &apos; , out , spokesman of the society . 
, was necessary providing the measures of protection of the supervise and the flora . 
is a long snake-heads of metal that overvalued as 242 and not is interrupted in all their length : or by , or by stations of peacekeeping . 
measures a platform of control in the waters of , but the responsible of project to the same the see that the swedish not were very prepared to allow that a society state russian is of way permanent in the sea with to their coast . 
&apos; case of , the step of gas in least of a minute &apos; , precise . 
case of brain , the gas of pipeline is , by therefore , to the atmosphere . 
the arrangements they little likely that is would a brain , since that have be that , according the forecasts , will a brain every place years . 
control of state of pipeline is does by a starting , by a vessel , that for inspections foreign , so as by a has that everything by the internal of pipeline . 
the way of a pure , is introduces in the internal of , that has a diameter of a metre , and is all with the gas . 
their arrival , after three hours complete of journey to a at of three metres by second , supplies data precise on possible of metal . 
pipeline has been designed for work during fifty years without need of no kind of . 
movement of gas is does simply by the pressure . 
principle is of 200 and , to the exit of 100 . 
companies have uk their forces for power carry to out this project . 
company leader is , that has the 51 % of the financially . 
she , is the german and ( % every a ) , so as the reporting and the group french ( 9 % every one ) . 
five societies have created a company common , so-called , committed of build and exploiting the pipeline . 
their headquarters in , , where the taxation is especially favourable . 
, to this society , during a long-term of twenty-five years renewable , the whole of the capacities of transport of gas . 
&apos; you in by the capacity total , regardless of the amount of gas that really is transport &apos; , precise . 
funding of the construction of pipeline is has taken just in a 30 % with the contribution of the and in a 70 % by loans banking . 
cost total of the labour should achieve million of eur for the two . 
, by example , the investment has reached the million . 
the weaker are insurance of that not their investment , since that moderating by yes only the risk of the expenses . 
pipeline of in , in a at of . 
, with producing metres of all , form the door of exit of gas . 
a sensors that the pressure , the temperature and the characteristics specific of gas to the arrival , before of that is owed to the pipelines germans . 
the last tuesday , the terminal , a million of metres accumulation of gas russian every time . 
total capacity , will three million by time and in 2012 , six million . 
, a of mark . 
ago half century by a company italian , want restore to the people the will by the . 
a air of adventure , of hours of to the light of a . 
is recognised easily , with their solder this , their rubber , their of colour white breaking , as by the time . 
however , the with the aspect current born ... in 1997 . 
company italian , based in , decided in at time launch the market a of brief of design , but . 
, by at then of the company , is acted of launching of new product . 
is disposition in a former technical of production , the ( fur of ) , that is concerns to a cotton that is dispense , between other things , for cover the .

golden the success . 
2006 and 2010 , the sales by in a 26 % , to achieve a volume of million of units . 
has been the production confidential of the first years , in the that only is lifts individuals . 
will more beyond of the borders italian and seeing their products to 70 countries , since to . 
difficult determine the profile of one , since that the of brief attracts therefore to men of business as to students and professionals . 
as that , their users are , of spirit open and coming . 
small company italian , that had with twelve workers in their beginning , now has close of 100 and , since 2008 , has two offices : a in and the other in . 
their in moving , since the to the small shops of centre of the cities , and has known impose their identity . 
&apos; we to the times and to the need of write , to despite of booming of the post electronic &apos; , explains .

their success and this cultural , has known diversify their products : , acts , , of computer ... mark ways a wider range of . 
success that from : in autumn of 2006 , was acquired by the fund of investment , in the today , so a new indeed in the history of . 
? what the rate of unemployment of the workers disabled still being so higher ? 
of 19 % of the people disabled are for a employment . 
for the employment of the disabled starts today . 
despite of a policy public settled , roundly since 2005 , the rate of unemployment between the people disabled greater the rate average : a 19 % , with the 9 % for the whole of the population . 
? ? 
&apos; &apos; , says , director general of , the partnership that &quot; the week for the employment of the disabled . 
&apos; progress infrastructural since ago fifteen years are considerable . 
&apos; at then , the rate of unemployment not was two sometimes but three sometimes more higher that the average . 
&apos; however , still is great by do &apos; . 
mention that the unemployed disabled are facing to many obstacles for access the employment . 
have a age more elderly : the 37 % has more of 50 years ( a 17 % of average ) . 
a level of jobs little high : the 80 % not has over the and , of the 2.3 million of students in the education higher , so only 000 are disabled . 
last , the unemployment of long long-term is very widespread between them : the 53 % for the disabled , with the 38 % of average . 
say , there many issues that especially the return the world labour and that &apos; are the of problem &apos; , out , director general of , a partnership created in 1992 for help to the companies to cases workers disabled . 
are the obstacles objectives . 
, there those that not is mention ; the mentality of the people is , but too slowly . 
study done in april by the partnership for the that that the directors have &apos; a level of knowledge on the persons under &apos; , with a &apos; representation excessive of the people in wheelchair of wheelchair , physical or intellectuals &apos; . 
result : the companies private with more of 20 workers are very far of aim of cases a 6 % of workers disabled , aim that is in a law of ... 1987 . 
the last figures available , that rim of 2008 , at a relationship of % . 
&apos; whole in about the 3 % &apos; , out , director general of , the body responsibility of power the contributions of the companies that not climate-friendly this law . 
test : the number of establishment &apos; subject to this contribution &apos; , the as that the , have has between 2007 and 2011 , and of to structures ( and of to million of eur ) . 
&apos; law of 2005 , that the contributions , has led a great pressure for the companies &apos; , explains . 
&apos; this improvement also reflects a real , in particular between the large groups &apos; . 
the of , so only the 59 % of the societies that they between 20 and 49 workers account with employees disabled in their , with the commitment % of the companies of between 100 and workers .
