Title: Language Model Creation
This Assigment aims to build language model and determine the language of the word. The classification is at character level. So for each character unigrams, bigrams,trigrams
probability is calculate to determine the language of the word.

Code.py 
Complete source code can be found in Code.py. Please run the Code.py to find the results.
The code is written in python using NLTK libraries & UDHR data is used.
